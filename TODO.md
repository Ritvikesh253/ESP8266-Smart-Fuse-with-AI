# TODO – Hardware v2 (feature/hardware-v2)

## Planned Features:
- Experiment with different ESP modules (ESP32, ESP32-S3, NodeMCU)
- Integrate additional sensors (temperature, humidity, power quality)
- Implement advanced current/voltage calibration techniques
- Add support for multi-phase monitoring
- Design custom PCB for production-ready hardware
- Explore energy harvesting for self-powered sensors
- Test with different current sensor modules (ACS712, SCT-013, INA219)
- Add wireless communication alternatives (LoRa, Zigbee)

## Steps:
1. Research ESP32 advantages over ESP8266 for this application
2. Test new sensor modules with existing codebase
3. Design and simulate PCB layout
4. Order prototype PCBs and components
5. Validate calibration accuracy with reference equipment
6. Update firmware to support new hardware variants
7. Document hardware setup and wiring for new modules
8. Performance comparison between v1 and v2 hardware
